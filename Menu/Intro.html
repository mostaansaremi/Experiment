    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
           EcoRacer is an online game originally designed to analyze human cognition based on the data collected from game players for challenging design and control problems.
           In this game participants control an electric vehicle that follows a pre-generated track. The objective of the game is to reach the finish line within a limited time with the highest remaining battery. 
           After starting the game, players can control the vehicle using an acceleration and a brake button. As the vehicle accelerates, the battery level drops, while braking regenerates some energy back to the battery.
           The electric motor is connected to the vehicle through a single gear. Players need to select an appropriate gear ratio from a list of options to improve their results.
