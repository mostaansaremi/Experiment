                 The primary objective of this research is to understand how usersâ€™ trust is formed in an Artificial Intelligence
            (AI) designed for a driving game and how trust impacts their decision-making based on how the AI system is designed.

                <li>We will ask you to play an online driving game supported by an AI.</li>
                <li>We will ask you some questions about your trust in the AI in that game.</li>
                <li>We will use the data from the game and your answers for analysis purposes.</li>
