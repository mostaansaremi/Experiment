        <h1>Game instruction</h1>
        <h2>Experiment Overview:</h2>

        <p>
            In this experiment, you'll engage in four different versions of the game: <br><br>One without an AI assistant and three with AI assistance. You have the chance to play each version five iterations. Following each version, you are required to respond to a corresponding questionnaire. <br>The primary goal of the game is to complete the track with the maximum available battery.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Game Mechanics:</h2>

        <p>
            The game simulates the physics of real electric cars, where acceleration consumes battery energy, and braking generates electricity to recharge the battery. The energy consumption is influenced by factors such as the slope, shape, and weight of the vehicle.
        
        </p><br>

        <h2>Game Interface:</h2>

        <p>
            Refer to the diagram below for an illustration of the game setup. <br>The control inputs involve pushing the (A) button on the screen or the right arrow  (&#8594;) on the keyboard to accelerate, and pressing the (B) button on the screen or the left arrow (&#8592;) on the keyboard to brake. <br>Releasing the buttons puts the vehicle in neutral mode, allowing it to continue motion based on the current conditions.
            <br>On the top of the interface, there's a timer indicating the remaining time, a bar displaying the slope of the track, and the distance left. The central battery icon indicates the remaining energy in the vehicle.
            
        </p>

        <h2>AI Assistant Features:</h2>

        <p>
            In versions with AI assistance, you'll find additional information in the lower-left corner representing details about the AI model. In the bottom center, there are two arrows indicating AI recommendations. A green (&#8593;) arrow suggests accelerating, a red (&#8595;) arrow suggests braking, and (-) indicates a recommendation to release the buttons and let inertia move the vehicle.
